## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the code and demonstration media for an image-guided surgical navigation system built on the Niryo NED2 robotic arm. Using ArUco‚Äêmarker tracking and homogeneous transformation matrices, the robot aligns its end-effector along a pre-planned trajectory from an entry port to a tumor target‚Äîin simulation of minimally invasive neurosurgical biopsy or excision.

## üî¨ Why This Matters

- **Precision Medicine**  
  Integrating real-time imaging with robotic control augments surgeon dexterity, enabling sub-millimeter accuracy in critical procedures (e.g. biopsies, drug delivery, neurosurgery).

- **Software-Biotech Synergy**  
  Demonstrates end-to-end pipeline: computer-vision (OpenCV/ArUco), rigid‚Äêbody kinematics (DH transformations), and real-time robot control (pyniryo API).  

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  Modular codebase easily extends to different cameras, markers, or robotic platforms‚Äîideal for R&D in medical device prototyping.
